# 🌐 **StackIt – A Minimal Q&A Forum Platform**

---

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**

Modern question-and-answer platforms have become increasingly complex and cluttered, making it difficult for users—especially beginners or small communities—to focus on meaningful content. Many users are overwhelmed by unnecessary features, distracting interfaces, and steep learning curves.

**StackIt** is designed to be a **minimalistic, easy-to-use Q&A platform** that supports the essential features required for knowledge sharing: asking questions, answering, upvoting, and searching content. It eliminates noise and focuses purely on content-driven interactions, making it ideal for small teams, classrooms, and niche tech communities.
